# Public-hygiene grep, over the whole history.
#
# This repository is public. Nothing in it may name our internal estate:
# the GCP project, a Secret Manager entry, a VM, a jump host, a private
# address, the QA airdress, or a test account. The grep runs over every
# object in the history, not the working tree, because a public
# repository publishes the history too.
#
# Two modes:
#
#   (default)   the tracked files as they are now. This is what the hook
#               and CI run, because it is what a change can fix.
#   --history   every blob in every reachable commit. This is the
#               pre-publication audit. A finding here cannot be fixed by
#               a commit, only by rewriting the history — which happens
#               only on the owner's word — so its findings are recorded
#               and decided, not quietly removed.
#
# Two things are deliberately NOT in the pattern list. The ZITADEL
# issuer hostname carries the project name and is nonetheless public by
# necessity: every user's CLI contacts it, and the hub serves it from
# `/api/cli/oauth-config`. And `a.airdr.es` is the public hosting zone
# where customers' airdresses live, not an internal name; the QA
# airdress on it has its own pattern below.
